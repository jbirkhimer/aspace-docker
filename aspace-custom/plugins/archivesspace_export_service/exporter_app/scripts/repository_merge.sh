#
# This script takes one or more paths to git repositories and produces
# a new git repository (under $WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY) which is the
# result of merging those repositories together.  If
# $WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY is already populated, it will work out which
# commits need to be integrated and merge them in.
#
# The mechanism for doing this is as follows:
#
#   * Our target repository has a local branch corresponding to each
#     source repository.  This is used to keep track of the last
#     commit we have applied from each source.
#
#   * We fetch from each source repository, and determine which
#     commits were added since we last merged.  We can do this by
#     comparing our local branch to the remote branch.
#
#   * We then cherry pick this range of commits onto our target
#     branch.
#
#   * Finally, we update our local branch to match the remote, marking
#     those commits as having been merged.
#
# One potential for problems is if we get interrupted halfway through
# the process of cherry-picking the commits, as we could end up with a
# state where our target's master branch contains some commits but not
# others (which would cause subsequent runs to re-merge those commits
# and create merge conflicts).
#
# We get around this by writing a "snapshot" file at the beginning of
# the whole process.  This records a copy of all of our branches at a
# known good state and, if we're interrupted at any point, we use this
# file to roll back.
